# API documentation

This directory contains generated API documentation.

- `gfm.css`: an approximation of GitHub markdown styles. This file lives here.
- `index.html`: is generated for developer usage in reviewing the generated docs and is excluded from git.
- `index.md`: the API document, generated by `Taskfile generate-docs`, which uses our custom script to generate all api documentation in one markdown file. 
- `openapi.json`: The openapi spec file, generated by `Taskfile generate-openapi`.
